## Description
This project is a clone of the popular game 'Wordle,' featuring most of the gameplay mechanics and a close replica of the UI.

## Project Goals
This project is a practice exercise. By replicating Wordle, I aimed to improve my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills while enhancing my problem-solving abilities.

## What I Learned
While making this project, I worked with methods I wasn't comfortable with, which helped me understand them better. By examining the UI layout of the original page, I also picked up some tips and tricks they used to improve the website/UI.

## Future Improvements
There are many things I would like to add to the page if I had the chance to build it again. For example, I would like to create a version that works with another language or use APIs to get today's word, syncing all the data with localStorage, and so on.
